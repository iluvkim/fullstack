            THE LAW OF DETACHMENT

            <p>When you detach from everything, you attract everything. When you don't need any external energy to complete you, everything becomes inherently attracted to you.
               <br> When you don't need anything, you gain everything. The best things in life come to you when you aren't searching for them.</p>
