    <h1>Embrace Your Unique "Flavor"</h1>
    <div>
        Just like ice cream, everyone has their own preference. Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not good enough; it just means something better suited for you is on the way. Love yourself and trust that the right opportunities will find you.

    <h1>Become a Magnet for Opportunities</h1>

    <h1>Trust the Journey</h1>
    <p>Setbacks aren’t failures; they’re stepping stones. Stay patient, stay focused, and know that something amazing is coming your way.</p>
